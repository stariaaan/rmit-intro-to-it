                        believe my ideal teammates would have these traits:<br><br>
                        - Actively communicate to understand the team’s goal, personality of each member, and asking for
                        help when needed.<br><br>
                        - Take responsibilities for the assigned tasks. Each member should know what they are good at
                        and what they want to improve upon, so tasks can be divided properly.<br><br>
                        - Each member should be able to take and give constructive feedbacks.<br><br>

                                            I want to create an application based on the concept of "Share all that we
                                            have," which is critical during this lockdown.
                                            Residents in one area can donate food, clothing, and medicine to the local
                                            checkpoints.
                                            At the same time, people in need of resources can check to see if there is
                                            anything they require at their local checkpoints, call the number listed in
                                            the description,
                                            or chat on Zalo/Viber if they are unable to make a phone call.
                                            People can use this application to ask for help from their neighbors when
                                            their needs are unique and require immediate assistance.
                                        <h4 class="fw-bold">#motivation</h4>
                                        My motivation for this application is because of a man who attempted to go out
                                        after the curfew to obtain an oxygen cylinder for his son, who has hemangioma
                                        liver, at home because he only knew of one reliable source <a

                                            & Vu, 2021)</a>.
                                        I have also tested positive for COVID-19 and have been treating it at home, so I
                                        understand how difficult it is to obtain medicine if the government is not
                                        present to assist.
                                        That is why I am hoping to create this application to support others who are in
                                        need of assistance during this difficult time.

                                            In order for this to succeed, the local government/military would need to

                                            <li>A friend of mine (s3854233) suggested that I look into the Google Maps
                                                API. Originally, I planned to post a list of all the checkpoint
                                                locations, and people would choose the ones that were closest to them.
                                                Because, based on my previous experience with delivery applications on
                                                the market, such as Grab and ShopeeFood, they provide us with options
                                                about the nearest stores based on how far away they are rather than the
                                                stores within the allowed neighborhood.
                                                It takes users a long time to find a store both within the allowed area
                                                and have what they need to buy.
                                                However, giving users the option to type in their addresses is
                                                preferable because it allows us to record each user's home address,
                                                which we can then use in future donations.

                                            <li>
                                                For testing purposes, he also suggested that I'll need at least two
                                                devices or emulators.
                                                This feedback made me realize that I had completely forgotten about the
                                                testing process. Emulators can be free of charge and allow developers to
                                                test faster, but eventually, we need the actual devices to test on
                                                before releasing the application to the public.
                                                The debugging process could be a challenge if there were no devices to
                                                try since the bugs might only be visible on the actual devices.

                                            <br>
                                            <li>
                                                Another friend (s3804811) gave me feedback on using Bootstrap 5 for
                                                faster website development. Besides the application, this project should
                                                also have a website for more people to use.
                                                To do it fast and precisely, using Bootstrap that are cultivated by many
                                                professionals could help speed up the process and give developers more
                                                time to tackle other problems. I have never used Bootstrap before, so I
                                                decided to try it for this personal website project.

                                                He said there should be a UML diagram for a better visual presenting.
                                                UML diagram aims to visualize a system, along with its attributes,
                                                structures, behaviors, and many more.
                                                This feedback gave me an overview of the UML diagram as I did not know
                                                what it is.
                                                Using a UML diagram is also a better way to communicate ideas between
                                                developers and investors. In case I want someone to invest in my
                                                projects in the future, I should prepare a UML diagram for better
                                                negotiation.

                                            Inquiring for constructive feedback helped me understand what I could do to
                                            improve my application for this project and projects in the future.
                                            There are aspects I don't have enough experience and knowledge to tackle.
                                            While conducting online research is a good practice, asking opinions from
                                            people with different points of view may provide me with more helpful
                                            information that I would remember longer.

                                            In my project ideas, I mentioned that I would use Firebase for the
                                            development. Firebase is a cloud service that provide real-time and
                                            collaborative applications.
                                            Using cloud computing services to host a website or an application has
                                            become a common practice in recent years.

                                                            lets users choose as many services as they need and charge
                                                            only what they use, while eliminate the worries of investing

                                                            This feature helps lower operating costs, allowing the

Nowadays, almost everyone has a cloud storage account to save and share at least 15 gigabytes of data.</p>
                                                        <p>- <strong>Streaming services/social media platforms.</strong> Most of the social media and entertainment sites are cloud-based applications. People can now stream what is happening for others who live in the other half of the world. Moreover, streaming services, such as Netflix and Spotify, offer people ways to entertain and connect with others.</p>
                                                        <p>- <strong>Education.</strong> Take Coursera, for example, a cloud-based education service that offers university courses for its users, who can study anytime and anywhere.</p>

Working from home is the norm for today society, many services have to adapt to these circumstances. Cloud-based services, such as Microsoft Onedrive and Google Drive, make collaboration more straightforward than ever. 
                                                            Employees from the same organization or students in the same class could view and share information quickly, increasing productivity and giving people more flexibility. Especially during COVID-19, its ability to let people work and study, as well as spreading information, is improving every day.

                                                            As the need for these services increase, more inventions would be created. Some of the services and hardware to use them only available to people from the middle class and higher. However, during this pandemic where elementary students, even kindergarten students, must study online, it is challenging for every family to prepare all the needed technologies.

I believe that the more accessible computing is, the more technology-based life will become. From the experience I have studying at RMIT, Cloud-based technologies have been giving me an adaptable study environment. 
                                                            The learning management system combined with communication tools, Instructure and Teams, enable students to participate in class, rewatch the lecture videos to study at their own pace, sharing working files with other students via Cloud-based storage.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Besides online study, Cloud-based shopping sites and delivery applications provide people with easy access to buying essential goods. Without the need to protect the physical server during lockdowns, these companies could let their employees to work from home and finding ways to adapt to the new normal, letting users like my family and myself continue to use their products.

                                                            It is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, and data from malicious attacks. The term is used in a variety of contexts, ranging from business to mobile computing, and can be classified into a few general categories.

                                                            Network security is defending computer networks against attackers. Application security is keeping software and devices safe from threats because a compromised application may expose its data. Data integrity and privacy are protected by information security. 
                                                            The processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets are operational security. Operational security includes the permissions that users have when connecting to a network as well as the procedures that govern how and where data can be stored or shared. 
                                                            By failing to follow good security practices, anyone can inadvertently introduce a virus into a secured system.

                                                            In the near future, AI could be a very big part in improving security. Nowadays, we can see smartphones and personal laptops using biometric security, such as fingerprint, face recognition, and it is already difficult to break into the devices with these security measurements. 
                                                            Integrating AI to information security could help prevent leaking sensitive information, for both internet users and organizations. Take Gmail for example, Google already using AI to block spam emails every day.

It is also extremely challenging to test for potential security gaps in large and complex networks manually; on the other hand, AI can handle it. It is now possible for a security system to be frequently updated and get the latest security patches.

                                    Tech industry changes so fast and requires us to update our knowledge constantly. In order to stay updated, I do these:
                                    <br>
                                    <br>- Read books and articles

                                    <br>Tech industry is fast paced, so besides strengthening my statistics and programming skills, I also try to find little tricks that can help me work faster - reducing manual work as much as possible. I also work closely with my manager to prioritize my work, to make sure I focus on the most important and impactful project all the time. In the tech industry, it is becoming more and more popular to work from home. Knowing how to find focus, work productively at home, but also keep a balance with our life is very important.
